# COVID-19-Sensor-Data-Android-App

Developed an android application that collects sensor data like heart rate, respiratory rate, location, and asks the user to fill up a questionnaire about COVID-19 symptoms and stores them in a database in the smartphone. The database is then uploaded to a server using WiFi and a contact matrix is returned to the phone.
